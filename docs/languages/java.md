### **Java Features**

* **Java Build and Run**:  
  Polydev allows you to build all Java files in the `src` directory with the press of a keybind. Once built, you can run the project from the `out` folder, with the `Main.java` file executed automatically.

* **Project File Management**:  
  The plugin manages your Java project files efficiently, helping you quickly add new Java files to the `src` directory. It also ensures that your build and run processes are streamlined.

#### File Structure
Here’s the recommended structure for your Java projects using Polydev:

| Directory/File Path        | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/`                     | Contains the source code files, including `Main.java` |
| `build/`                   | Contains compiled `.class` files                     |
| `Main.java`                | The main entry point of your Java project             |

#### Example Structure:

```md
Projects/
└── Java/
    └── Project_Name/
        ├── src/
        │   └── Main.java
        └── build/
            └── *.class
```
