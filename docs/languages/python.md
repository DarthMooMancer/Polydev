### **Python Features**

Here are some cool features available for Python projects using Polydev:

- **Automatic Virtual Environment Creation** ðŸ”§  
Each Python project automatically sets up and uses a new virtual environment. You donâ€™t need to worry about environment management. Just install your dependencies with `pip` as needed.

- **Dependency Management with Pip** ðŸ“¦  
Need to install Python modules? Simply type the name of the module in the terminal, and Polydev will take care of the installation using `pip`. You can even update `pip` if required, ensuring smooth installation.

- **Effortless Dependency Handling** âš¡  
You no longer need to manually activate or deactivate virtual environments. With Polydev, the environment is set up and activated automatically, simplifying your workflow.
