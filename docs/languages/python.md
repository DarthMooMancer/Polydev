#### Keybinds 🎮
You can easily customize the keybinds for your Python projects using Polydev.

| Keybind             | Action                                            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

#### Configuration Example:

```lua
require("Polydev").python.setup({

    ["<leader>pb"] = "PythonPip"   -- Install dependencies using pip
  }
})
```

#### Python Features 🚀

Here are some cool features available for Python projects using Polydev:

- **Automatic Virtual Environment Creation** 🔧  
Each Python project automatically sets up and uses a new virtual environment. You don’t need to worry about environment management. Just install your dependencies with `pip` as needed.

- **Dependency Management with Pip** 📦  
Need to install Python modules? Simply type the name of the module in the terminal, and Polydev will take care of the installation using `pip`. You can even update `pip` if required, ensuring smooth installation.

- **Effortless Dependency Handling** ⚡  
You no longer need to manually activate or deactivate virtual environments. With Polydev, the environment is set up and activated automatically, simplifying your workflow.
