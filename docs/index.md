# 🚀 Welcome to Polydev

Polydev is a highly customizable and extensible Neovim plugin aimed at streamlining project creation and management for multiple programming languages. It’s especially suited for developers who work across different languages and want a consistent workflow for initializing, building, and running projects.

## ❓ What is Polydev?

Polydev is designed to be a centralized workspace tool that reduces repetitive tasks involved in setting up development environments. Whether you’re working on a Lua plugin, a Rust CLI tool, or a C++ project, Polydev helps you scaffold project directories, create boilerplate code, and define keybinds to streamline execution — all from within Neovim.

## 💡 Why Polydev?

Modern development often involves juggling multiple languages. Setting up similar environments repeatedly or manually running commands wastes time. Polydev solves this by providing:

- 📦 **Project templates per language**
- 🎯 **Custom keybindings for common actions**
- 💻 **Floating terminal support**
- 🗂 **Easy file creation and directory structure generation**
- 🔌 **Plugin-first architecture to expand functionality**

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🌐 **Language Support**: Define custom settings per language including `project_root`, `keybinds`, and `build_attributes`.
- 🪟 **Floating Terminals**: Run builds and executions in a Neovim floating terminal.
- 🧱 **Scaffolding**: Automatically create the appropriate directory and file layout for new projects.
- 🎹 **Keybind Mapping**: Rebind keys to execute project-specific commands like `Build`, `Run`, or `Test`.
- 🔌 **Pluggable**: Designed to easily integrate with other tools or extend with your own commands and language presets.

## 👥 Target Audience

Polydev is perfect for:

- 🧑‍💻 Developers building across multiple languages
- 🔌 Plugin authors and power users of Neovim
- ⚡ Anyone who wants automated project bootstrapping

## 🎯 Goals

- 📏 **Consistency**: Provide a common interface for all your dev projects.
- 🧩 **Extensibility**: Let users add their own languages and tools.
- ✨ **Simplicity**: Reduce boilerplate and context switching.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Say you're a developer who works with Rust, Lua, and Python. Instead of remembering build commands, directory structures, or manually creating a `main.rs` or `init.lua`, Polydev:

1. 🏗 Sets up your directory based on language conventions.
2. 📄 Generates boilerplate files.
3. 🎛 Maps `<leader>pr` to `Run`, `<leader>pb` to `Build`, and so on.
4. 🖥 Opens a floating terminal to show your output.

## 🏷 Versioning

Polydev uses GitHub tags and branches to manage plugin versions. Each version corresponds to a stable release that users can track.
