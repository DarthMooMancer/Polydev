# üì¶ Installation

Polydev can be installed using any plugin manager of your choice‚Äîor even manually. Below are some examples for popular managers to get you started.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: The `opts` and configuration values shown below are simply examples. You can customize them based on your preferences or even omit them entirely if not needed.

> üí° **Heads up!** Many language presets in Polydev require a file named `<project_name>.polydev` in your project root. If it's missing, Polydev will let you know (loudly üòÖ).

> **Note**: Languages that require to build just need to be run, building is builtin to the run command
