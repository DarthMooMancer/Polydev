# Setup and Customizing Polydev

## Project Manager
> Note: The project manager closely follows the netrw keybinds and allows for project management all in one spot

| Binding          | Description   |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Enter** | `Open file / Enter directory` |
| **../** | `Go to parent directory` |
| **/**    | `Filter (fuzzy search)` |
| **a**    | `Create new folder` |
| **%**    | `Create new file` |
| **d**    | `Create new project` |
| **R**    | `Rename file/folder` |
| **D**    | `Delete file/folder` |
| **q**    | `Quit popup` |

## ðŸ”§ Project Name Customization
You can easily customize the default directory for your project! The project can be created from any directory, and Polydev will automatically create the required project root directory for you.

> **Note:** `project_root` allows you to customize where your project will be stored. If you don't specify it, the default is `~/Projects/Language`.

### LazyVim Example

```lua
return {
    ...
    opts = {
        <language> = {
            project_root = "~/Home/..." -- Default: ~/Projects/Language
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

### Packer Example

```lua
require("Polydev").language.setup({
    project_root = "~/Home/..." -- Default: ~/Projects/Language
})
```

## âŒ¨ Keybinds Customization
Polydev allows you to easily manage keybinds, providing a uniform way to interact with different languages. Most keybinds are the same across languages, while some have language-specific ones (e.g., Python's pip keybind).

### Keybind Categories
| Keybind Type      | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Universal**     | Cannot be changed through specific language settings (e.g., `<leader>po` for project manager). |
| **Per-language**  | Can be customized per language (e.g., `<leader>pr` for language run). |

### LazyVim Example

```lua
return {
    ...
    opts = {
        <language> = {
            ["<leader>pr"] = "languageRun",   -- Per-language
            ["<leader>nh"] = "NewLanguageSecondaryFile",  -- Universal
            ["<leader>po"] = "PolydevManager", -- Universal
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

### Packer Example

```lua
require("Polydev").language.setup({
    keybinds = {
        ["<leader>pr"] = "languageRun",   -- Per-language
        ["<leader>nh"] = "NewLanguageSecondaryFile",  -- Universal
        ["<leader>po"] = "PolydevManager", -- Universal
    }
})
```

## ðŸ–¥ Terminal Customization
You can further tweak the terminal settings to suit your preferences! These options allow you to adjust padding, borders, numbers, and scrolling behavior.

### Available Terminal Settings
| Setting          | Default Value   | Description                                             |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **presets**       | `center`      | Presets for where the terminal is placed in the buffer  |
| **border**        | `true`          | Adds a rounded border to the window.                    |
| **number**        | `true`          | Displays line numbers in the terminal.                  |
| **relativenumber**| `true`          | Displays relative numbers based on cursor position.     |
| **scroll**        | `true`          | Enables scroll functionality in the terminal.           |

> **Note:** These terminal settings allow you to personalize the terminal view and improve usability. You can easily adjust the padding, borders, and other aspects to your preference.

### Available Presets
| Preset | Placement |
|--------|-----------|
| **center** | `completely centerd in the screen with a small amount of padding on each side of the buffer` |
| **right_panel** | `takes up about a third of the right side from top to bottom with a small amount of padding` |
| **center_panel** | `takes up about a third of the center from top to bottom with a small amount of padding` |
| **corner** | `takes up about a fourth of the bottom right corner with a small amount of padding` |

return {

    opts = {
        terminal = {
            presets = "center"
            border = true,
            number = true,
            relativenumber = true,
            scroll = true,
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

### Packer Example

```lua
require("Polydev").setup({
    terminal = {
        presets = "center"
        border = true,
        number = true,
        relativenumber = true,
        scroll = true,
    }
})
```
